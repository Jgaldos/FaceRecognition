# Face Recognition with Elastic Bunch Graph Matching and Constrained Neural Fields

##Description:
This is a new implementation of Face Recognition with Elastic Bunch Graph Matching and Constrained Neural Fields oriented to increase process speed by moving most of the algorithm to gpu and using threads.


##Requirements:
- Opencv 
- Cuda

##TODO:
- add descriction of project
- add face detector on cuda
- add(Write from zero) to thesis project a sort of face tracker to organize the detection results
- rewitre Gabor Mask Extraction in cuda
- find a way to use CNFL on cuda or threads
- Test a video on real time
